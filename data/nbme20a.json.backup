He cannot have a lumbar fracture because he is young and there is no indication for a weak lumbar area in him. The deltoid rupture would not cause back pain. The sciatic nerve is very thick and will not \"tear\" but it is being compressed here due to the herniation. A torn muscle in the lower back would not have back pain."
