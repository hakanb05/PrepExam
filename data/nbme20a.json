Which structure is most likely involved in this incision? Perineal body. It is essential to the integrity of the pelvic floor and cut in a midline episiotomy. AMBOSS explains that fecal incontinence is a common complication of 3rd degree perineal lacerations from the posterior vaginal wall to the external anal sphincter, and in severe cases possibly the internal anal sphincter. Injury to the pudendal nerve (S2-S4) is also related."
