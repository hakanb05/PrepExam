A midline episiotomy is a vertical incision from the posterior vaginal wall to the perineal body.\n\n AMBOSS explains that fecal incontinence is a common complication of 3rd degree perineal lacerations from the posterior vaginal wall to the external anal sphincter, and in severe cases possibly the internal anal sphincter.

It's pretty normal (no megakaryocytes, no increased number of platelets, no rods, nothing blue, etc). A blood smear from a COPD patient will be normal. Just an increased number of RBCs due to the increased EPO leading to increased Hgb.\nMyelofibrosis — also called agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM), myelosclerosis, chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, idiopathic myelofibrosis, and myelosclerosis with myeloid metaplasia — is a form of cancer that arises in the bone marrow."
