A midline episiotomy is a vertical incision from the posterior vaginal wall to the perineal body.\n\n AMBOSS explains that fecal incontinence is a common complication of 3rd degree perineal lacerations from the posterior vaginal wall to the external anal sphincter, and in severe cases possibly the internal anal sphincter.

It can be differentiated from E. Coli (EHEC) because E Coli doesn't have as much person-to-person spread and only causes GI damage by the shiga-like toxin, not a direct invasion. Therefore, EHEC wouldn't facilitate as strong of a neutrophilic response.\n\nTenesmus refers to cramping rectal pain.
